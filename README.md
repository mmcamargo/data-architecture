## Description

This repository houses the back-end of a web application developed as a requirement for the Back-end I module. The API has been designed to facilitate efficient consumption by the [front-end](https://github.com/mmcamargo/back-end-I) developed in parallel while maintaining well-structured code. Initially, the API doesn't rely on any database. However, in the Database I module, the project was refactored to be integrated with a Postgres database utilizing TypeORM.
